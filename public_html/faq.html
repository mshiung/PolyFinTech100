                    The first things banks look at is the borrower's reputations or track records for repaying debt. Banks extract credit reports from a credit bureau to find out this information. A credit report reveals important details such as:
					<br />
The credit history means the record of a person's current loans, the date of a person's loans, the amount of the loans, the person's payment record on the loans, current liens against the person's property, and the person's most recent financial statement.
					<br />
Credit history is a record of a consumer's ability to repay debts and demonstrated responsibility in repaying debts. This information is all contained on a consumer's credit report. A consumer's credit history includes the following:
					<ul>
					<li>Number and types of credit accounts </li>
						<li>How long each account has been open</li>
						<li>Amounts owed</li>
						<li>Amount of available credit used</li>
						<li>Whether bills are paid on time</li>
						<li>Number of recent credit inquiries </li>
					</ul>
A consumer's credit history also contains information regarding whether the consumer has any bankruptcies, liens, judgments, or collections.

                    <a class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse32">6th problem statement: “The digital world has created new behavioural patterns and interaction principles influencing the values of the younger generation.” What are the new behavioural patterns and interaction principles?</a>
                </h4>
            </div>
            <div id="collapse32" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    These are what the younger generation likes in terms of interactions and values:
					<br />
<strong>1. Fully digital consumption</strong>
					<br />
The younger the customer, the less he really wants to interact with business representatives to solve his problems when using a product or a service. Around 30% of Generation Z stated that they prefer to find information online and cope with the problem themselves.
					<br />
Their multitasking is shocking. They are able to interact simultaneously with dozens of digital channels. Emails are gone, left only for business communication. Still don’t have notifications in your service app? Well, that’s no good. Don’t hesitate to enable them. Use as many digital channels as possible, be everywhere with your young customers.
					<br />
They live in a world of innovation. And most of all appreciate the real-time experience. This means that banks must closely monitor trends and use situational marketing to provide hyper-personal experience. It’s important to switch from traditional advertising to native formats.
Many banks still invest in the channels which are ineffective for the new generation. Users wish to make more transactions online — from simple payments and transfers to loans and investments.
					<br />
<strong>2. Design rules the world</strong>
					<br />
Unlike the previous generations, the new generation loves with the eyes, not with the ears. Don’t expect a catchy tagline to be an excuse for outdated site design and apps. Visual details are paramount for the new generation.
					<br />
Preference is given to the visual content and the brands are judged by their taste and the beauty they bring into the users’ lives. It also means that visual channels are dominating in user experience (e.g. social media feeds, apps, chats, video blogs, visual mems).
					<br />
In particular, young people don’t like to talk on the phone. Studies show that the younger the target group of users is, the less popular phone communication is. Forrester Statistics revealed significant differences among “Millennials” — only 49% of respondents from generation Y (23–37 years) preferred communication with company representatives on the phone, in contrast to the Generation Z (16–22 years) — 38%.
					<br />
Still, the Millennials are the most active age group using social media for communication. For example, instead of calling support, the younger generation will look for a tutorial on the Internet or will contact the company online. They’ll be frustrated if they don’t find anything of that kind.
					<br />
<strong>3. Total transparency</strong>
					<br />
This generation is used to sharing private information. Therefore they’ve got a different attitude towards privacy. Easy registration and services with open ID are better for them than time-wasting secured forms. They won’t understand why the provider complicates the usability of the service because of safety standards.
					<br />
The Millennials really appreciate the quality of the service and they are willing to sacrifice something to obtain a maximum level of service. According to a Salesforce study, 61% of respondents do not mind sharing their personal information with the business, in case it will make product or service interaction both offline and online more personalised. Also, 58% of Millennials said that they are ready to share this information to get more accurate recommendations related to their interests.
					<br />
This is the obvious difference between young people and the previous generations — for example, among the group of baby boomers, i.e. people born in the period 1943–1963 years, only 41% of users would share personal information.
					<br />
<strong>4. Authenticity instead of loyalty</strong>
					<br />
They don’t stick with brands and are not loyal to them. Why? Because they can find hundreds of the same offers online, evaluate them with ratings and reviews, and choose the most suitable one. Unlike the traditional approach of creating brand value through mass advertising, multiple repetitions, and a unique proposal, in future, the main value of any brand will be its social capital: the number of fans recommending this service and hyping it online.
					<br />
As a result, instead of market positioning, that usually doesn’t have anything to do with reality, the brand authenticity and its correspondence with the values of selected niches, confirmed in its actions, and also its willingness to build customer-oriented relationships, based on the business model, become of utmost significant for the business.
					<br />
The Millennials don’t need any explanations: they judge everything by their own experience. It is important for them to feel their value to the company. If a young man reckons the business is not careful enough for him, he will go to a competitor. No regrets.
					<br />
For example, in the Forrester survey, 21% of Generation Z stated that a reason to change the company could be the poor social media support and the lack of functionality of the product, not to mention a bad mobile app (23)%.
					<br />
The Kasasa study revealed that 82% of Millennials don’t mind changing banks and 83% of them would go to the competitors who offer more favorable conditions (interest rates, cashback, etc.). 65% of the users would choose a more convenient mobile app.
					<br />
<strong>5. Disrupting media</strong>
					<br />
They consume content in a completely different way. Forget about TV and commercials. Become a favourite service of а popular blogger, and no advertising is needed. Create useful content inspiring customers and they will become your loyal customers and advertising agents (and free of charge).
					<br />
Today, blogging and gathering loyal audience is typical for the younger generation. They start making their online communication network from their childhood. So, they are no longer traditional media consumers. They become media themselves.
					<br />
Young consumers are the most demanding critics, not forgiving brands for arrogance, deceit and neglect. Their expectations of the minimum level of service often meet the highest quality standards and they do not forgive mistakes. The news of bad service spreads quickly, filling thousands of sites. For any brand this could be the beginning of the end.
					<br />
In practice, the younger generation doesn’t mind speaking publicly about their user experience. According to Accenture statistics, 70% of Generation Z who purchased offline and online, wrote reviews and 40% stated that they do it regularly.
					<br />
<strong>6. Social responsibility</strong>
					<br />
They understand the meaning of life and they are therefore more focused on human values. And at the same time, they are incredibly pragmatic. This means, they will not swallow the brand’s promises — they are keen on certain actions: here and now. Actions which change the world for the better.
					<br />
Empty marketing promises do not work here — brands will have to answer for their words and to show the meaning of their existence. It may seem surprising, but the new generation is aware that they are guests on this planet, and looking for responsive service.
					<br />
They are aiming at not just saving the planet for future generations, but also at improving it. 
					<br />
<strong>7. Expecting dialogue</strong>
					<br />
With the social networks, communication has become a primary activity for young users. They are in a constant interaction with each other through digital channels. This means that the brands of the future should be open for dialogue. They can’t expect that cooperation will remain unilateral, as in “take it or leave it”.
					<br />
Younger users are used to the fact that their opinions are heard. The willingness to dialogue is becoming the hallmark of today’s service. Consultations about complex products are really important. The feedback, properly collected, and processed becomes a valuable source of business insight for development and improvement.
<br />
In order to win customers from the Millennials and Generation Z, businesses need to put the customer in the center of the universe and double their efforts in ensuring the highest quality design, and a reliable, personalised, and cheerful user experience.
<br />
Young people are open to the world: they prefer to spend money on the impressions, not on the things. They are searching for convenience. In the coming years, winning customers will become the driving-force of the global economy. This will be a successful task for the companies who have a better understanding of the needs of the younger generation and are able to design services which provide an outstanding user experience.

                    In many SEA countries outside of SG, physical banks may not be available to many areas as it may not make business sense to operate these branches. Even if the physical banks are there, there is a cost barrier to excess the services. E.g. must have minimum balance, monthly fees, transaction fees. So these consumers will choose not to open an account and thus missing out on the digital economy.

                    For many unbanked markets, the payment is normally cash on delivery (COD). This system has it’s problem as the merchants risk losing its money when the delivery services run away with their money. Also, given the geography of the rural places, the collected payments may not reach the sellers until 1 week later, thus causing cashflow issue for them. Counterfeit notes is also an issue with COD. <br />From the consumers’ point of view, thrust is also a factor they choose COD as they are worried that the product they ordered may not arrive after payment has been made. The trust issue is especially prominent for small merchants that they have no brand presence.

                    Traditional bank normally assess loan application thru the borrowers credit standing, if they have no banking relationship with the bank, their credit standing cannot be established, creating a vicious cycle. Also, with the lack of physical bank branches in rural area, many small business cannot build this relationship. PayPal has a working capital loan that allow PayPal merchants to borrow small capital from PayPal based on their business transactions that do on their PayPal account.

                    Most QR Payment provider are merchant acquirers themselves, and their QR code can only be paid by their own payment applications.  This confuses many consumers and merchants with the following:
					<ul>
					  <li>The consumer is required to download the multiple payment apps in order to scan and pay to the correct QR code.  Payments processing may slowed down, resulting in long queues because the consumer is required to: 
						  <ol>
							  <li>Search for the payment app and launch from the mobile phone</li>
							  <li>Login and navigate to the scan & pay feature from the app</li>
						  </ol>
					</li>
					  <li>Merchants stores having many Static QR labels/stickers placed at the cashier counter.</li>
						<li>Merchant may receive monies from many different payment providers which makes account reconciliation tedious.</li>
					  <li>For NETS QR, some consumers would state the payment wallet name instead of NETSQR which at times confuses the merchants, example payment by (PayLah!, OCBC/UOB Apps)</li>
					</ul>
					NETS have thus far tried to unify QR payment applications with SGQR, however SGQR is not supported for dynamic payments, generated with dynamic requirements.

                    Banks typically use credit reports, which are available from Credit Bureaus such as Credit Bureau Singapore (<a href="https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/">www.creditbureau.com.sg</a>), as well as a proprietary and secret ‘scorecard’. These scorecards take into account key factors such as age, gender, education, employment, household income and other details to determine the anticipated credit worthiness of a potential borrower. This credit worthiness is an estimate of the ability to repay the loan. If the bank estimates the borrower can repay the loan without issue, then the loan will be approved. Sometimes, a loan may be approved but for a lower value than requested. Sometimes the loan will have a different interest rate depending on various factors.
